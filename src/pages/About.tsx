       I'm who specializes in building design and build responsive, high-performance web applications using modern technologies like React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS â€” turning complex ideas into clean, functional user interfaces. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through small projects and collaborative builds that explore real-world frontend challenges and modern UI patterns.

      In my spare time, I love exploring new frontend tools, contributing to personal projects, and experimenting with design systems or UI animations. I also enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends and refining my skills through online challenges and community learning.
